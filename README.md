# The Project Summary
In this position control project, a ping pong ball is levitated respectively to two reference points determined in the pipe with the air the turbofan provided. The data received from the distance sensor is processed in Arduino MEGA and the required PWM signal is produced with the PID control algorithm. Position control is provided by sending the generated PWM signal to the fan via the control circuit unit.
